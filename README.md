# Discord-DM-Bot
Discord bot that generates a Dungeons and Dragons dungeon. Used for a group to be able to play DnD over discord without the need for a DM.

Initially this bot uses a database to randomly generate attributes needed for a dungeon crawl using bot commands to "roll" against the tables set up in the database.
